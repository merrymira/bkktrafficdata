**Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict an Effective Green Signal Period Based on the Real-Time Traffic Flow**

This project uses machine learning models to predict green signal durations based on traffic data. Addition to the original dataset, this project has engineered features such as average vehicle speeds, traffic density, and road distance between intersections, to train the model. 
Ultimately, the Polynomial Regression model is the best-performed model, compared to Linear Regress, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. This enables automate traffic traffic control to optimize the traffic flow at an intersection.
